# Building-Stable-Diffusion
ðŸ¤— Diffusers library provides a convenient inference pipeline for Stable Diffusion. This notebook attempts to build the pipeline from scratch using the components of Stable Diffusion, namely, Variational Autoencoder, U-net, Schedulers, and Text Encoders. This allows for a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes as an image is generated, given a prompt, and provides better control over the output images. Further, we also explore the Image-to-Image pipeline that allows us to perform diffusion on a given input image instead of starting from pure noise. For a detailed explanation, refer to [this](https://darkknightxi.github.io/blog/posts/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion.html) blog post.
